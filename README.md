# Techniques of Modern Astrophysics (Winter 2019)

Welcome to the code repository for PHY 4910U Techniques of Modern Astrophysics.  Here you'll find my "official" code.

To make use of this code, you should first make your own "branch" so that any changes you make won't affect this code.  Give your branch a descriptive name (don't use "branch").
